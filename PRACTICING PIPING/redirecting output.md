# Redirecting Output
The challenge asks us to redirect the output onto some other directory.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{IkxcW6m3QtBTU_sVkAxK2TLhR3I.QX0YTN0wyMxkjNzEzW}'

First we execute the ' echo PWN > COLLEGE' command which gives us the flag

```
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{IkxcW6m3QtBTU_sVkAxK2TLhR3I.QX0YTN0wyMxkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learnt how Linux commands have commands to redirect the output in some other directory
## References
None.
