# Intro To Arguments
Learning basics on interacting with the command line

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{cEMJbCepeJrDg1fXpmIRX4WG0Iq.QX3YjM1wyMxkjNzEzW}'

First we execute the 'hello' command to get the flag keeping in mind that HELLO will not give the flag

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cEMJbCepeJrDg1fXpmIRX4WG0Iq.QX3YjM1wyMxkjNzEzW}

```

## What I Learned
I learnt that the command line is case sensitive and how to execute the most basic commands

## References
None.
