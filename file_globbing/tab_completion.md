# Tab Completion
The challenge asks you to use tab key to get the flag

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{UlirLQ2dx4SB543zELC0EHDbyi9.0FN0EzNxwyMxkjNzEzW}'
We execute the "cat /challenge/pwn" and tab with it which predicts what is going to be your next word

```
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollegeâ€‹
pwn.college{UlirLQ2dx4SB543zELC0EHDbyi9.0FN0EzNxwyMxkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learnt how Linux commands provides us "tab" command to use it predicting next words

## References
None.
