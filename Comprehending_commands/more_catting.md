# More catting practise
The challenge asks you to get the flag from a different directory without using "cd" command 

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{MAb8cKMpzDTzmbRyz_bLcuKsbnd.QXwITO0wyMxkjNzEzW}'

First we execute the "cat" with the argument of a different directory which is given so we go into the different directory to get the flag

```
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /lib/firefox/browser/flag
pwn.college{MAb8cKMpzDTzmbRyz_bLcuKsbnd.QXwITO0wyMxkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learnt how  to retrieve the flag without using the "cd" command instead by using the "cat" command
## References
None.
