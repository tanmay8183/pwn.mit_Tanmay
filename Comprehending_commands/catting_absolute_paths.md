# Catting absolute paths
Catting absolute paths without copying in home directory

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{Y7eH0oegsytHDBHxbhV1qo35m6N.QX5ETO0wyMxkjNzEzW}'

First we execute the "cat /flag" command which is only read and not copied in the home directory and after executing this command we get the flag

```
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{Y7eH0oegsytHDBHxbhV1qo35m6N.QX5ETO0wyMxkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learnt how to read using cat command

## References
None.
