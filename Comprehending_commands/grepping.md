# Using "grep"
The challenge asks you to serach for the substring among thousands of files using "grep"

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{o3IzuSyJy9H3xaHiv_eqhuHYaEM.QX3EDO0wyMxkjNzEzW}'

First we execute the "grep" command by specifying the substring and also the path of the file using the given path 

```
hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{o3IzuSyJy9H3xaHiv_eqhuHYaEM.QX3EDO0wyMxkjNzEzW}
```
