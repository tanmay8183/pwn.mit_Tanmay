# Moving Files
The challenge asks you to move files from one directory to another

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{AIkMublgjBGNy8qbd8g4vS_gj4b.0VOxEzNxwyMxkjNzEzW}'

First we execute the "mv" command follwed by the file we want to shift and then followed by the path where we want to input the file

```
hacker@commands~moving-files:~$ mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet
Correct! Performing 'mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet'.
hacker@commands~moving-files:~$ /challenge/check
Congrats! You successfully moved the flag to /tmp/hack-the-planet! Here it is:
pwn.college{AIkMublgjBGNy8qbd8g4vS_gj4b.0VOxEzNxwyMxkjNzEzW}
```
